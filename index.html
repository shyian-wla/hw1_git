                Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

            <p>
                Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

                There are many interesting projects available from GitHub and other public Git repositories that you can clone freely to your own computer. Why would you want to do that? One reason is to learn something about coding style, practice, and tools in a language of interest, including commit log commenting style (see tip No. 4). A second reason is to learn how a given project accomplishes its goals. A third reason, should the licensing both permit you to do so and make sense for your purposes, would be to incorporate the project into your own endeavor or product. Double-check the license, by the way, so that you donâ€™t run into compliance issues later on.
